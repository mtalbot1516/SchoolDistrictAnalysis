# Analysis of School District student & school Data

##overview of the purpose of the analysis

###The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of student and schools in the district, as well as the entire district as a whole. We evaluated the pass rates for students in both reading and math, as well as overall pass rates. We had to reanalyze the data due to Academic dishonesty at Thomas High School. Further Analysis by recording calculating these metrics by grade level, spending per student and shcool size

##Results
*The district summary effect is marginal and statistical analysis would most liekly suggest it to be non-significant. If you reference "Resources/District_Post_THS-edit" and "Resources/District_Pre_THS-edit"" You will notice that the reading math and overall % passing rates moved by less than a point each
*There was a significant change in the schools summary. All three percents calculated increased by at least 20 points. See "Resources/THS_Pre_edit" and  "Resources/THS_Pre_edit" for more detail on the large gaps between the data
* Pre-adjustement, Thomas High School was the 8th best school by overall passing percantage. After the adjustment they became they had the second best overall passing percentage. In general, they became a much higher ranked school after removal of 9th grade scores
  * Math and reading scores by grade maintained the same except the was a null value input for 9th
  * Scores by school spending did not change
  * scores by school size did not change
  * schores by school type did not change
